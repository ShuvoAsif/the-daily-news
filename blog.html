                        <h3>Difference between var,let and const</h3>
                        <p>A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a variable exists and what value
                            it should start with. Similar to other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the
                            declaration of variables.

                            There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and
                            const. Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create
                            can be used.

                            let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a
                            value.

                            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in,
                            which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.
                            var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing
                            it to a value.

                            Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was
                            declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.

                            const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a
                            variable that can’t be reassigned.

                            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they
                            are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned. </p>

                        <p>JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but
                            they have some very important differences: Syntactical differences, this value (execution
                            context),Usage as methods, Usage as constructors, arguments binding.

                        <p>why we will use template string
                            Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                            insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate
                            like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and
                            contain dynamic elements.</p>
